# 🚀 Locus Blaster  
**A Web3-Ready 3D Arcade Shooter Built in Unreal Engine 5**

Locus Blaster is a fast-paced, futuristic arcade shooter that blends immersive 3D gameplay with Web3 identity integration. Players blast through waves of enemies while their in-game stats and progress are tied to their blockchain identity — offering a glimpse into the future of connected gaming experiences.

## 🎯 Vision  

Locus Blaster aims to **redefine player ownership and engagement** by connecting traditional gaming fun with Web3 mechanics.  
Through seamless sign-in and data verification powered by **Hedera**, the game experiments with how blockchain can enable decentralized progress tracking, digital collectibles, and cross-platform player identities.

This MVP focuses on building the **foundation** — authentication, gameplay, and proof-of-concept connectivity — while preparing for future extensions like NFT-based rewards, player marketplaces, and community-driven upgrades.
